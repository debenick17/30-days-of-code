# 30 days of code - Log
### Day 0: Saturday 26rd May 2019

**Today's Progress**: I read through the opening chapters of the book **_Adam Freeman - Pro Angular 6-Apress (2018)_** and did the angular project on chapter 2. This project was about a small and simple todo app with basic angular features.

**Thoughts**: I find myself pushing what I did on my day 0 on day 1 instead because of some connection issues I experienced. I wish this doesn't happen frequently.
