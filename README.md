# 30 days of code - Log
### Day 0: Saturday 25rd May 2019

**Today's Progress**: I read through the opening chapters of the book **_Adam Freeman - Pro Angular 6-Apress (2018)_** and did the angular project on chapter 2. This project was about a small and simple todo app with basic angular features.

**Thoughts**: I find myself pushing what I did on my day 0 on day 1 instead because of some connection issues I experienced. I wish this doesn't happen frequently.

### Day 1: Sunday 26th May 2019

**Today's Progress**: I tried to complete one of the Javascript projects on freeCodeCamp, which is about a [Telephone Number Validator](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/telephone-number-validator/) but I couldn't. I nevertheless succeeded to pass some checks but that was not what I needed. I wanted to implement everything needed. It had much to do with regex so I have to deep dive into some regex and enter into it tomorrow. While I was pondering on the solution of the Number validator, I tried out the next project which was a Cash Register and I don't know how but I implemented it.

**Thoughts**:I feel like getting hands on make you re-read and understand some concepts better.
