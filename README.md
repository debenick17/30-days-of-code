# 30 days of code - Log
### Day 0: Saturday 25rd May 2019

**Today's Progress**: I read through the opening chapters of the book **_Adam Freeman - Pro Angular 6-Apress (2018)_** and did the angular project on chapter 2. This project was about a small and simple todo app with basic angular features.

**Thoughts**: I find myself pushing what I did on my day 0 on day 1 instead because of some connection issues I experienced. I wish this doesn't happen frequently.

### Day 1: Sunday 26th May 2019

**Today's Progress**: I tried to complete one of the Javascript projects on freeCodeCamp, which is about a [Telephone Number Validator](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/telephone-number-validator/) but I couldn't. I nevertheless succeeded to pass some checks but that was not what I needed. I wanted to implement everything needed. It had much to do with regex so I have to deep dive into some regex and enter into it tomorrow. While I was pondering on the solution of the Number validator, I tried out the next project which was a Cash Register and I don't know how but I implemented it.

**Thoughts**:I feel like getting hands on make you re-read and understand some concepts better.

### Day 2: Monday 27th May 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I read chapters 2 and 3 of the Angular Pro book. I also solved some javascript exercises, summing in a range, diff two array and a seek-and-destroy function.

**Thoughts**: Maybe someday the programming language you know won't matter any longer. Maybe some technology will come up that will convert java code to javascript or to python or whichever language of your choice. He! he! he! I am just pondering like my point says "**thoughts**", lol.

### Day 3: Tuesday 28th May 2019

**Today's Progress**: Solved some freecodecamp challenges. For some upcoming days I will be doing that.
